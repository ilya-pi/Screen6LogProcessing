Tech Soup

### Prerequisites

In order to run this script you require:

1. `bash`
1. `gzip`
1. `md5`
1. `gawk`
1. `pigz`

While first three (`bash`, `gzip` and `md5`) are default to Mac Os, you will require to install `gawk` (GNU Awk) and `pigz` 
(Parallel gzip implementation for unix/linux) in order to run it. Sadly `awk` won't do as there is no conventional way to 
ignore term separators inside double quotes in true Awk (the magic `FPATH` thingy).

Whether you use `macports` or `brew` installing should be fairly simple. For Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/):
    
    brew install gawk
    brew install pigz

### Running

To run sample script that will take gziped logs and process them, producing output to your `STDOUT`:

    cd ./scripts
    ./main.sh ../data/

Benchmarks
----------

### Configuration

 1. **Processor**: 2 Ghz Intel Core i7
 1. **Memmory**: 8 Gb 1333 Mgz DDR3
 1. **Disk**: SSD

### Measurement Method

All numbers are obtained with Linux/Unix `time` command. All given times are `real` (in a sense 
that `time` provides you with `real`, `user` and `sys` times).

In a normal experiment, I would've run each test approx 100 times and then show the `80%`, `90%` 
and `95%` percentile, but I didn't go that way here for simplicity's sake.

Notes on the code and choices
-----------------------------

Final solution consists of a bash script, that handles the framework around log processing and a small Java class to 
handle a single line of log.

Each time a log file is processed, that fact is stored in the `processed_files` file, that keeps current application state. Whenever 
you interrupt file proessing and then start over, for each file, it will check whether it was processed already, and whether 
it was not — pick it up.

Since we are reading from the disk, and writing back to it, and normally that is very expensive, I decided to read data from 
gzipped files and compress them on the fly right back to gzip, after processing was done.
